# PHP Recursive Function Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug involving a recursive function in PHP that performs string manipulation.  The function aims to process nested arrays, replacing occurrences of the '@' character in string values. However, the implementation has a subtle flaw leading to unexpected or incorrect results. 

The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version.  The issue highlights the importance of carefully managing data structures and string operations within recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.
